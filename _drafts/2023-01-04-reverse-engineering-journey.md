##### "Do the things that scare you the most."  My Reverse Engineering Journey!

I found reverse engineering hard last year i'm not gonna lie! Getting to understand a software or piece of code from it's low level binary..down the assembly opcodes felt tough for me; too much for a lad to bear. I was still getting started in Cybersecurity and didn't know yet what i wanted to pursue or focus on. I learned rev to experience the field, get to know what exists.   

This year, i'm going to push harder! I wan't to become a Malware Analyst and reverse engineering is a core skill in unravelling and identifying what a piece of malware is designed to do. Understanding how a malicious software is intended to operate; how it spreads for viruses and worms. The skill of Reverse engineering helps Malware analysts create even more robust defense mechanism; coming up with rules which detect and perhaps shut-down programs with behaviours flagged strange.  

This post will act as a catalogue and listing of my Reversing journey this year. From the mere basics to even more advanced topics that i will be learning. Hopefully, you will learn something too.  

#### Let's start here!
