Fundamentally, we understand that the "Engineering" concept is about building and designing a component. It's about actualizing an idea. Well, Reverse engineering is the opposite. **Reverse engineering** is a process of trying to understand an entity or anything that is already built. It's about getting to know how that model functions and operates. Reverse engineering has more often been seen in science. Remember the Corona Virus in 2020. Great men and women of science worked day and night in research attempting to disect that little tiny living thing, all trying to understand how it goes so nuke spreading and affecting a large amount of people in a short while.  Or let's say the germany code breakers whose work was to analyze enycrypted messages captured from the enemies mesengers and try to 'solve back' the mechanism used to encrypt or if they are lucky hoping to get the ultimate key used. All these was reverse engineering.

In technology, Reverse Engineering is not different. Competitors spend time examining each others softwares to figure out others secret design methodology.  

Today, there different motives in reverse engineering. Security researchers perform security related reverse engineering like reversing cryptographic algorithms; encryption algorithms; trying to crack and break them creating decryption algorithms without the key. This allows evaluation of an algorithm before it's implemented. Security engineers, vulnerability researchers  and the bad guys crackers(So called hackers) too reverse software applications to identify weaknesses perphaps from poor programming or implementation. While vulnerability reaserchers objective is to audit, identify risks and provide mitigation strategies the crackers on the other hand fight to exploit and take advantage of these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to systems and steal data,encrypt files, disrupt business operations.....either for fame or money.  

Malware Analysts in the front line of defending organization networks and systems also perfom reverse engneering on Malicious software(Malware) used by the crackers to penetrate, and try to disect them; understand how they work and how they can defeat them.  

In this journey we shall try to learn fundamentals of Reverse engineering Software applications. We wil first understand the Computer architecture, and then the Assembly language which will be the highest level of code we will be dealing with in reverse engineering. See you next time when we talk about the coputer architecture.
