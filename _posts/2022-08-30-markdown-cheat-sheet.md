Markdown is a very popular and easy to use markup language. It's simplicity widens the range of its usage from **blogging, creating documents to even technical documentations.** I'll be highlighting the basic syntax of markdown to get you started using it.

Markdown files take the extension **.md or .markdown**

1. **Headings:** Markdown headings are prepended the hash(#) symbol. The more hashes you prepend the smaller the heading. 
# \#Heading1
## \#\#Heading2
### \#\#\#Heading3


2. **Paragraphs:** separate paragrahs with one or more lines.  
    This is paragraph one.  

    And this is paragraph two.

3. **Line Breaks:** to create a line break(\n). End a line with two or more spaces.   
    This is a first line.  
    This is another line.  

4. **Bold Text:** to bold a text, enclose it within 4 asterics \*\***Bold Text**\*\*

5. **Italicize text:** to italicize text, enclose it within 2 asterics. \**Italics*\* or underscore \__Italics_\_

6. **Bold and Italic:** to empasize text with bold and italics at the same time choose either \*\*\_**_Very Important_**\_\*\* or \_\_\*__*Very Important*__\_\_\* or \_\_\____Very Important___\_\_\_ or \*\*\****Very Important***\*\*\*

7. **Code:** to write words as code enclose them with backtics(\`) `print("Hello World!")`

8. **Block quote:** to create a block quote prepend a \> to the text.  
> \>This is a block quote

9. **Lists:** lists can either be ordered or unordered. 
    **Ordered Lists:** to create an ordered list use numbers followed by periods. A list doesn't have to be in order but must start with number one.  
    1. This is number one.  
    2. This is number two.
    5. This is number five.

    **Unordered Lists:** use dashes(\-), astericks(\*) or plus signs(\+) infront of the items. 

    - Item one
    - Item two

    * Item one
    * Item two

    * Item one
    * Item two

10. **Images:** to include an image use \!\[name\]\(image/path/filename.jpg\)
![Image](/assets/images/cheat-md.webp)

11. **Links:** to create a link use [\[Link Text\]](htts://linksite.com)\(https://linksite.com\)

11. **URL:** to turn an email into a link enclose it with angle brackets \<c1ph3rbnuk@gmail.com\> becomes <c1ph3rbnuk@gmail.com>

13. **Escaping Characters:** use backslash(\\) to represent character as literals that would be otherwise be interpreted.   
    \\\*  
    \\\_  
    \\\-  
    \\\#  
    \\\!  
    \\\{\}  
    \\\`
